<h1>vBulletin 4.0 Software License Agreement</h1>

<p>This Software License Agreement (this "Agreement") is between you (either an individual or an entity, referred to hereinafter as "you" or "your") and vBulletin Solutions, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Internet Brands, Inc., and its affiliates ("vBulletin Solutions", "we", "our" or "us") for the vBulletin 4.0 software that accompanies this Agreement, as may be updated or replaced by feature enhancements, software updates or maintenance releases (the "Software") and any services that may be provided by vBulletin Solutions under this Agreement ("Services"). Do not use the Software until you have carefully read the following Agreement.</p>

<p>By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or using the Software (or authorizing any other person to do so) you are indicating that you are 18 years of age or older (any parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 may accept this Agreement on behalf of a user), are capable of entering into a binding legal agreement, have read and understand this Agreement and you accept its terms and conditions. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not install, copy, access, download or use the Software.</p>

<h2>1. Grant of License</h2>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, vBulletin Solutions grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to install, download and use a single instance of the Software on a single website server ("License") through a single installation. Each License may run one instance of the Software on one domain. Any modification of the Software intended to circumvent the foregoing is prohibited and will result in revocation of the License.</p>

<p>If you are the original licensee of the Software, you may make a one-time, permanent transfer of your license rights in the Software to a third party ("Subsequent Licensee") provided that five (5) conditions are met.  The conditions are: (a) you are the original licensee, (b) the Software was purchased by you more than 90 days prior to the transfer, (c) you do not keep a copy of the Software for yourself, (d) the Subsequent Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and the License, and (e) the Subsequent Licensee agrees to assume your license rights in the Software, excluding this transfer right. For sake of clarity, the right to transfer the Software belongs solely to the original licensee; the Subsequent Licensee is prohibited from transferring its rights to any third party. You must disclose the domain where you are using (or plan to use) the License, which may be disclosed in the vBulletin registered members area. You may set up one additional temporary test forum for the purpose of testing code, template and database modifications. Such a test forum must be password protected, and not made available to the general public at any time.</p>

<p>For purposes of this Agreement, "Software" includes (and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to) any updates, updated or replacement features enhancements, bug fixes or modified versions (collectively, "Update"). "Update" means a release of the Software which adds minor functionality enhancements to the current version. This class of release is identified by the change of the version number to the right of the decimal point, i.e. 4.1 to 4.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you have no License or right to use any such Update unless, at the time of acquiring such Update, you already hold a valid License to the original Software and have paid any applicable fee for the Update.</p>

<h2>2. Restrictions</h2>

<p>You may not give copies to another person, or duplicate the Software by any other means, including electronic transmission. You may make one copy of the Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. You may not rent, sublicense, assign, lease, loan, resell for profit, distribute, publish or network the Software or related materials or create derivative works based upon the Software or any part thereof.</p>

<p>You may not use the Software to engage in or allow others to engage in any illegal activity where the Software is accessed and used. You may not use the Software to engage in any activity that will violate the rights of third parties, including, without limitation, through the use, public display, public performance, reproduction, distribution, or modification of communications or materials that infringe copyrights, trademarks, publicity rights, privacy rights, other proprietary rights, or rights against defamation of third parties.</p>

<h2>3. Ownership Rights</h2>

<p>The Software is licensed to you by vBulletin Solutions for use only under the terms and conditions of the License. vBulletin Solutions reserves all rights not granted to you. The Software in its entirety is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws and treaty provisions. vBulletin Solutions owns and retains all right, title and interest in and to the Software, including all copyrights, patents, trade secret rights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights therein. Your possession, installation, or use of the Software does not transfer to you any title to the intellectual property in the Software, and you will not acquire any rights to the Software except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. All copies of the Software made hereunder must contain the same proprietary notices that appear on and in the Software, including all Software copyright notices embedded in any design template which must remain unaltered from the original and visible at all times. vBulletin is a registered trademark of vBulletin Solutions in the U.S. and in the U.K.</p>

<h2>4. Termination</h2>

<p>The License for the Software is effective until terminated. You may terminate the License at any time by uninstalling the Software and destroying all copies of the Software in any media. This Agreement may be terminated by vBulletin Solutions immediately and without notice if you fail to comply with any term or condition of the License or this Agreement. Upon such termination, you must immediately cease using the Software, and destroy all complete and partial copies of the Software.</p>

<p><strong>Leased-License Holders Only</strong>. For leased-license holders of any previous version of vBulletin software, up to and including version 3.8, the License terminates on the last day of your current leased-license agreement with Jelsoft. You may, however, purchase the Software prior to such end date, in which case the License will continue as specified in the first paragraph of this Section 4. Use of the Software after that end date without purchase makes the License void and you must immediately cease using the Software, and destroy all complete and partial copies of the Software.</p>

<p>vBulletin Solutions reserves the right to change or add to the terms of this Agreement at any time (including but not limited to Internet-based Services, pricing, technical support options, and other product-related policies), and to change, discontinue or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of the Software, or any Internet-based Services provided to you or made available to you through use of the Software. Such changes will be effective upon notification by any means reasonable to give you actual or constructive notice including by posting such terms on the vBulletin.com website, or another website designated by vBulletin Solutions. Your continued use of the Software will indicate your agreement to any such change.</p>

<h2>5. Registration Data</h2>

<p>You must register to use the Software and Services and (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information as prompted by the sign-up process (the "Registration Data"), and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate, current and complete. If you provide any Registration Data that is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account unless and until such data is corrected or completed, or we may refuse any and all current or future access to and use of the Software or Services (or any portion thereof).</p>

<h2>6. Account Access Information and Data</h2>

<p>You are solely responsible for (a) maintaining the confidentiality and security of your access number(s), password(s), security question(s) and answer(s), account number(s), login information, and any other security or access information, used by you to access the Software and Services (collectively, "Access Information"), and (b) preventing unauthorized access to or use of the information, files or data that you store or use in or with the Software and Services (collectively, "Account Data"). We will assume that any communications we receive through use of the Access Information were sent or authorized by you.</p>

<h2>7. Fees and Payments</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to charge fees for future Services in our sole discretion. If we decide to charge for the Services, such charges will be disclosed to you prior to our charging for them.</p>

<h2>8. Feedback</h2>

<p>We may provide you with a mechanism to provide feedback, suggestions and ideas about the Software. You agree that we may use the feedback you provide in any way, including in future modifications of the Software. You grant us a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, non-revocable, royalty free license to use, modify, create derivative works from, distribute and display any information you provide to us in the feedback.</p>
